# LoRA-model-for-classification

This material is intended solely for educational purposes, focusing on a straightforward model trained on the MNIST dataset. The provided code will walk you through the process, from building a basic classification model and training it, to saving the trained weights in a checkpoint file, and reloading them for fine-tuning. The key aspect of this tutorial is learning how to fine-tune the model from scratch using (Low Rank Adaptation)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685] (LoRA) approach.

The code is designed with a clear structure, making it accessible and easy to understand, even for beginners.
